<h2 id="Preparation-to-be-a-NEWBIE-at-work"><a href="#Preparation-to-be-a-NEWBIE-at-work" class="headerlink" title="Preparation to be a NEWBIE at work"></a>Preparation to be a <font color=#DC143C >NEWBIE</font> at work</h2><p>At the beginning of 2020, we encountered a global pandemic that has brought countries to a standstill. From March to Spetember, I was the lucky one who kept my internship in the automotive industry. I proved my autonomy in the beginning of télétravail. I improved different algorithms for real time plotting and real time animation. What is more, as a foreigner, I brought myself to be integrated into an international team in a french company. However, under such kind of circumstances, our client has cancelled most of our projects (you know the car industry in 2020 sucks…), even my collegue who just passed the “période d’essai” could not stay. Hopefully, I finished my internship with my team and got my diplome in October. And now, it’s the time to bite the bullet and take this challenge to find a new job. Now, I’m the <strong>NEWBIE</strong> at work;)</p>
<p>After two-year study in France, what I learnt in school and what I developped in company are both related to signal processing and embedded software. Therefore, in the future, I hope that I can implement different signal processing algorithms into different anolog devices or electronic componants to create a more practical product.</p>
<p>For example, in the system of intelligent automotive. The system is connected with different built-in captors to receive digital signals from different on-board components. These data can be analysed by a specific control unit or we can caculate them in the cloud if we have a more complex system. All the result can be parsed and retransfered to users via HIM.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="My-Job-Search-Road-Map"><a href="#My-Job-Search-Road-Map" class="headerlink" title="My Job Search Road Map"></a>My Job Search Road Map</h2><p>I give myself 3-6 months to find a job in France or even in the whole world. The target industry before was automotive or aerospace industry. But considering about the situation in aeronautique industry, ok let me retarget to Internet industry and other electronics industries.</p>
<p>The following steps are all I need to keep in mind for my job hunting.</p>
<p><strong><font color=#FF8C00>1. Don’t be downcast</font></strong></p>
<p>In the last two days of my internship, I felt so frustrated that I couldn’t stay and work with my group and my boss. Beacuse my boss has a very “gossip” and adorable personality, and the working atmosphere between me and my colleagues was super great, I do want to stay with them. I also often went rock climbing or did some other after-work activities with my colleagues. Even though people around me encourage me that I could find a job given <strong>my professtional skills and outstanding qualities</strong>(yes, I know that I was flattered then), I couldn’t help myself but feel depressed. However, in the end I bring myself again to find a job during this difficult period. Because if I don’t believe in myself, how can I <em>convince the HR to employ me.</em></p>
<p><strong><font color=#FF8C00>2. Update profil</font></strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, we have tons of media to represent you: **CV, Cover letter, Referrence pages, LinkedIn, Personal blog, Wechat, Instagram…**I’m trying to update my LinkedIn profile/CV to ensure it reflects all my achievements and professional skills, so that recruiters can find me easily with the help of recommendation algo. And also, I try to refresh my profile or modify a little bit details twice or three times a month according to different areas of expertise.</p>
<p><strong><font color=#FF8C00>3. Expand my network</font></strong></p>
<p>This is my bottleneck…I started to think about the direction for my career very late. So basically I’m still on the progress of developing my <strong>career road map</strong> (because it needs more time and experience to outline the <strong>progression I want in my career, the industry/industries I want to pursue, the positions, and the type of companies in which I’m interested in.</strong>)</p>
<p>Hopefully, I do know my target industies, so that I can create a <strong>detailed list of employers</strong>, and I can do some research about the company, culture, growth initiatives, techinique projects. Besides, thank to LinkedIn, I can expand my connection with these companies and explore more professional opportunities.</p>
<p><strong><font color=#FF8C00>4. Keep Learning</font></strong></p>
<p>To be a better embedded software developper or signal processing engineer, I need to profond my studies without any doubt. Recently, I participate in Coursera to get certification in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> from Stanford University. For me, it’s also a good way to keep alert with basis theories about machine learning and a good way to do some math. What’s more, to better understand different deep learning frames, the online courses from google and microsoft are in my online courses list too. After going deeper with these courses, I will post more study notes about ML.</p>

<h2 id="Be-prepared-for-PhD-at-any-time"><a href="#Be-prepared-for-PhD-at-any-time" class="headerlink" title="Be prepared for PhD at any time"></a>Be prepared for PhD at any time</h2><p>Even I find a job, I will never say no to a PhD. My life goal is to be an expert in the filed of digital signal processing. Keep learning, focus on what I am doing now.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="To-be-a-geek"><a href="#To-be-a-geek" class="headerlink" title="To be a geek"></a>To be a geek</h2><p>This is my personal blog to record some study notes. As I indicated before, I want to be an expert in signal processing. But actually when I apply for jobs, sometimes I am entitled like: <strong><font color=#FF1493>Python Engineer.</font></strong> What’s interesting for me is that python is not an almightly language but can be oftenly used for full stack development, data analysis, operation and maintenance development.</p>
<p>Aha, that’s a good hint for me to be “almightly” <strong><font color=#FF1493>geek</font></strong>…</p>
